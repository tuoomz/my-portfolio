### Smart Wallet

**Shared Wallet:** 

👛 Have an on-chain wallet smart contract.

💸 This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again.

✌️ You can also give "allowance" to other, specific user-addresses.

🚫 Restrict the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user)

🔍 Re-Use existing smart contracts which are already audited to the greatest extent
